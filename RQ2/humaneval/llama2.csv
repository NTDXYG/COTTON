    - If the count of unique characters is greater than the count of unique characters of max_word, update max_word.
    - If the count of unique characters is equal to the count of unique characters of max_word, compare max_word and the current word lexicographically.
        - If the current word is lexicographically greater, update max_word.
Step 4. Return max_word. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize total number of eaten carrots as 0.
Step 2. Calculate the total number of carrots needed to complete the day's meals.
Step 3. Calculate the number of carrots left after the meals.
Step 4. If there are not enough remaining carrots, eat all remaining carrots.
Step 5. Return the array [total number of eaten carrots, number of carrots left after the meals]. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable ""result"" as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through the elements of operator and operand lists simultaneously.
    -If the current elements of operator and operand lists are the same, add the corresponding elements to result.
    -Otherwise, perform the corresponding algebra operation on the current elements and add the result to result.
Step 3. Return the final value of result. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty string result.
Step 2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
    -If the character is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa.
    -Otherwise, keep it as it is.
    -Append the reversed character to the result string.
Step 3. Return the result string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Import the hashlib module.
Step 2. Check if the input string is empty. If it is, return None.
Step 3. Create an instance of the hashlib.md5() class.
Step 4. Encode the input string using UTF-8 encoding.
Step 5. Update the md5 object with the encoded string.
Step 6. Get the hexadecimal representation of the md5 object.
Step 7. Return the md5 hash string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty list to store the even digits.
Step 2. Iterate through the range from a to b (inclusive).
    -Convert each number to a string.
    -Iterate through each character in the string.
        -If the character is a digit and it is a digit that is divisible by 2, add it to the list.
Step 3. Return the list of even digits. "
