Step 2. If the source is equal to the dest, return 0.
Step 3. If the absolute value of the difference between the source and the dest is greater than the step, return sys.maxsize.
Step 4. Calculate the minimum number of steps needed to reach the destination by subtracting the step from the source and adding the step to the dest.
Step 5. Return the minimum number of steps. "

    -Iterate through the string ""s"".
        -If the current character is equal to the next character, increment ""count"" by 1.
        -If the current character is different from the next character, append ""count"" to ""temp"" and reset ""count"" to 0.
    -Set ""s"" as ""temp"" after appending it to ""s"".
Step 3. Return ""s"" as the nth term of the ""Count and Say"" sequence. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize max_length as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through each element in the array.
