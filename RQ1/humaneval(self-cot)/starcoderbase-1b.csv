"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize total number of eaten carrots as 0.
Step 2. Initialize number of carrots left as the number of carrots you have.
Step 3. Iterate through operations.
    -add value to total number of eaten carrots.
    -If number of carrots left < 0, return [total number of eaten carrots, number of carrots left]
    -If number of carrots left >= 0, return [total number of eaten carrots, number of carrots left - 1]
Step 4. Return [total number of eaten carrots, number of carrots left]"
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize the result as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through the operator list.
    -If the operator is a basic algebra operation, add the corresponding operand to the result.
    -If the operator is a unary operation, multiply the result by the operand.
Step 3. Return the result."
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize result string as empty string.
Step 2. Iterate through s.
    -If s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
Step 3. Return result string."
