    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Note:
        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of"
"The string after the rotation is:
1. A B C D
2. A D B C
3. A B C D
""""""

### Example:
#"
"Let's think step by step.
1. Create a hash function, that takes a string as an argument and returns a string hash equivalent to the hash of the string.
2. Loop the input, find the latter hash letter in hash.
3. Return result."
"Let's think step by step.
1. Create a list of all the integers between a and b.
2. Loop the list, find the first integer between a and b.
3. Return the first integer between a and b."
