    -If the operator is -, add the value of the next operand to the result.
    -If the operator is *, multiply the result by the value of the next operand.
    -If the operator is //, divide the result by the value of the next operand.
    -If the operator is **, raise the result to the power of the value of the next operand.
Step 3. Return the result."
