"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable to count the number of even and odd digits.
Step 2. Iterate through the integer.
    -If the current digit is even, increment the count of even digits.
    -If the current digit is odd, increment the count of odd digits.
Step 3. Return a tuple with the count of even and odd digits respectively."

"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable to store the sum of the three sides.
Step 2. Iterate through the three sides.
    -If the sum of the three sides is equal to the square of the sum of the two sides,
    then the three sides form a right-angled triangle.
Step 3. Return True."
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize max_count as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through words.
    -If word has maximum number of unique characters, update max_count.
    -If word has same number of unique characters, update max_count if word is greater than max_count.
Step 3. Return the word with maximum number of unique characters."

Step 1. Initialize number of carrots as 0.
Step 2. Initialize remaining carrots as the number of carrots you have.
Step 3. Iterate through number of carrots.
    -If number of carrots is greater than remaining carrots, return False.
    -If number of carrots is less than remaining carrots, subtract number of carrots from remaining carrots.
    -If number of carrots is equal to remaining carrots, return True.
